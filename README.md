Game Description
A domino, the piece being played, has two numbers separated by a line. This
version of the game uses 28 pieces. The domino follows the following rules.
The version outlined below assumes two players:
• The game starts with all the dominos being placed face down on the table and mixed
around. This is called the boneyard.
• Each player selects 7 dominos and places them on the long edge so as to be able to see
them without being visible to the opponent.
• One player starts the game by downing (putting down) a domino face-up on the table.
• The players take turns.
• On each turn, the player downs a single domino matching the configuration on the
table.
• The dominos will form two parallel rows shifted by half a domino.
• Two adjacent dominos located on different rows must have the same value in the
overlapping halves.
• A blank is used as a wild card and thus matches any value next to it.
• If the player has a domino that can extend the line of play in either direction, they put
it down and their turn ends.
• If the player does not have a domino able to extend the line of play, they must pick one
up from the boneyard and must continue to do so until a matching domino is found or
the boneyard is empty.

• If the player has a domino able to extend the line of play, they cannot pick any pieces
from the boneyard.
• If the boneyard is empty and the player cannot extend the line of play, they end their
turn.
• The game ends when the boneyard is empty and either
– The current player places their last domino.
– Both players have taken a turn without placing a domino.
• At the end of the game, the dots on each player’s dominos are counted and the player
with the lower total wins.
If both players have the same number of dots, the player who last played a domino is
the winner.
